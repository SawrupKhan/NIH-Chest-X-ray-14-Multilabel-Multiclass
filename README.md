# NIH-Chest-X-ray-14-Multilabel-Multiclass-Classification
Developed a Keras 2.3.0-based diagnostic model capable of detecting 14 distinct diseases from chest X-rays. Employed both training and test-time data augmentation methods.
Then, Utilized the MobileNet architecture to process a dataset exceeding 100,000 chest X-ray images, incorporating a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function for training.
Implemented GRAD-CAM for visualizing affected areas in chest X-ray images pertaining to pneumonia disease.
